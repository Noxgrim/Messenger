# Messenger
A little project of two students.
It's our first "big" project so please excuse design and/or coding flaws.

## Function
The messenger will (hopefully) offer encrypted comunication via GnuPG.
You can use it via a terminal or a GUI. (Both modi are not finished yet.)

## State
Because we both have to do mutch work for school, this project is only a side project and we wont update it daily (sometimes the project could be paused for weeks or even months).
Currently the programm is in a very unfinshed state. You cannot run nor compile it.
