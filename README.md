 # (Abandoned)
 This project will most probably not be developed further.
 
 A little project of two students.
 It's our first "big" project so please excuse design and/or coding flaws.
 
## Features
 The messenger will offer encrypted communication via hybrid encryption (AES and RSA).
 You can use it via a terminal or a GUI. (Both modi are not finished yet.)
 
## Current State
 Because we both have to do much work for school, this project is only a side project and we won't update it frequently (sometimes the project could be paused for weeks or even months).
 Currently the programm is in a very unfinished state. You can neither run nor compile it. :-)
